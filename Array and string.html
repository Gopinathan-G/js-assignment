Q2.Explain with examples the remaining methods of String and Array?
STRING:
The substr() Method

The difference is that the second parameter specifies the length of the extracted part.
Example
var str = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";
var res = str.substr(7, 6);

Replacing String Content

The replace() method replaces a specified value with another value in a string:
Example
str = "Please visit Microsoft!";
var n = str.repl
ace("Microsoft", "W3Schools");

String.trim()

The trim() method removes whitespace from both sides of a string:
Example
var str = "       Hello World!        ";
alert(str.trim()); 

Converting a String to an Array

A string can be converted to an array with the split() method:
Example
var txt = "a,b,c,d,e";   // String
txt.split(",");          // Split on commas
txt.split(" ");         // Split on spaces
txt.split("|");       // Split on pipe

ARRAY :

An array is an ordered list of elements; each element has a value of any type. You can define an array by placing a list of values between brackets ([]):
 Example: let myArray = [2, 'Pete', 2.99, 'another string']

Associative Arrays

Many programming languages support arrays with named indexes.

Arrays with named indexes are called associative arrays (or hashes).

JavaScript does not support arrays with named indexes.

In JavaScript, arrays always use numbered indexes.  
Example
var person = [];
person[0] = "John";
person[1] = "Doe";
person[2] = 46;
var x = person.length;     // person.length will return 3
var y = person[0];         // person[0] will return "John" 

Modifying Arrays

Arrays wouldn't be practical if we couldn't modify them. We need the ability to add, remove, and replace elements. The [] operator and some array methods help us accomplish these tasks.

Example : 
                           let array = [1, 2, 3]
                           array[1] = 4
                            = 4
                           array
                           = [ 1, 4, 3 ]
