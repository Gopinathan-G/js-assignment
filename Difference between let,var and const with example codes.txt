Q2: The difference between var, let and const with code example

 var: -
1.      var is function-scoped
2.      var return undefined when accessing a variable before it's declared

let: -
1.      let is block-scoped
2.      let throw ReferenceError when accessing a variable before it's declared

const:-
1.      Const is block-scoped
2.      Const throw ReferenceError when accessing a variable before it's declared
3.      Const cannot be reassigned
Var example :

 var x = 5;
function a() {
    x = 6;
    return x;
}
console.log(x);
console.log(a());

Let example :

 let x = 5;
function a() {
    let x = 6;
    return x;
}
console.log(x);
console.log(a());

constant example :
  
 const x = 5;
function a() {
    let x = 6;
    return x;
}
console.log(x);
console.log(a());
