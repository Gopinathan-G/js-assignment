Q3. Datatypes in javascript
           In javascript there is two different kind of datatypes 
        1.primitive
       2.object
In javascript, there are six primtive data types:
*Boolean
*Number
*String
*Null
*Undefined
*Symbol

Boolean :
          A boolean represents only one of two values: true, or false.
        example: fun boo1 = true;
                                 fun boo2 = false;
Number :
          Numbers can be written with or without a decimal point. A number can also be +Infinity, -Infinity, and NaN (not a number).
          Example: var num1 = 32;
                                  var num2 = +Infinity;
String :
         Strings must be inside of either double or single quotes. In JS, Strings are immutable.
         Example: var str1 = 'hello, it is me';
                                 var str2 = "hello, it's me";
Null :
         Null has one value: null. It is explicitly nothing.
         Example: var nothing = null;
Underfined :
         A variable that has no value is undefined.
        Example : var testVar;
                                 console.log(testVar); // undefined
Symbol
         Symbols are new in ES6. A Symbol is an immutable primitive value that is unique. For the sake of brevity, that is the extent that this article will cover Symbols.
         Example : const mySymbol = Symbol('mySymbol');

Objects
      * Objects are not a primitive data Type.
      *An object is a collection of properties. These properties are stored in key/value pairs. Properties can reference any type of data, including objects and/or primitive values.

       Example : var obj = {
                                                       key1: 'value',
                                                       key2: 'value',
                                                       key3: true,
                                                       key4: 32,
                                                       key5: {}
                                                       }

Loosely Typed

        JavaScript is a loosely typed language. This means you don’t have to declare a variable’s type. JavaScript automatically determines it for you. It also means that a variables type can change. Let’s look at an example:
        We’ll create a variable named car and set it equal to a string value:

        Example : var car = 'ford';
